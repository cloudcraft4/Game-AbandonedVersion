# "Untitled" Roguelike-Game

This is the pre-Alpha version of my new roguelike game (which I am making purely for my own enjoyment).  
The game is extremely bare-bones at the moment but I hope to get it to a state that at least I enjoy. :)

Much thanks to Jo√£o F. Henriques for his excelent tutorial on how to make roguelikes in Python.

The game is written in Python 2.7 and is using the Libtcod 1.7.0 API.

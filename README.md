# "Untitled" Roguelike-Game

This is the pre-Alpha version of my new roguelike game (which I am making purely for my own enjoyment).  
I have abandoned this version because I want to be working with Python 3.  For now I am keeping this in case I want to look at what I previously did.

Much thanks to João F. Henriques for his excelent tutorial on how to make roguelikes in Python.

The game is written in Python 2.7 and is using the Libtcod 1.7.0 API.
